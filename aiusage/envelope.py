"""Envelope assembly — fetch a set of providers, wrap them in the outer object.

Split out of __main__ so that every in-process consumer builds the identical
envelope: the JSON backend (`get-ai-usage`) and the terminal frontend
(`aiusage.cli`). See docs/provider-contract.md for the shape produced here.
